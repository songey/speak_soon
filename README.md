# Speak Soon

The goal of this app is two-fold: 

  First, to allow users to connect with language exchange partners. The app will allow real time communication between users via video conferencing, text messages and voice recordings.
  
  Secondly, to serve as a place of study for language learners (users), to track the progress of their learning and incentivise them to stay involved with the language learning process. This will be done by the use of language exercises such as completing sentences or multi-choice vocab quizes.
